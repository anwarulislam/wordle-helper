# Wordle Helper
Wordle is a simple word game created by a Software Engineer Wardle. I made this simple helper app to show remaining words in each step.

I play Wordle game everyday. It's really fun and simple. We can play only once in a day and we do not share the actual answer rather some square sign to show our result. This is something interesting about this game. That's why it became a social game now.

When I play, I try to start with some known and easy word where we have maximum number of vowel. After trying three or four times I easily can guess the actual word. But, sometimes I can't remember words to try. That's why I thought it's better to create a simple solution to show remaining words in each step. And I created this solution using `JavaScript` and `VueJS`

## How it works?

It's actually very straightforward. When we write a word in Wordle and submit the word we see three state of characters of that word. It can be *PRESENT*, *ABSENT* or *CORRECT*. Wordle hightlight those state with color. Correct is Green, Present is Orange, and Absent is Gray. After trying in wordle if you want to see all remaining words in *Wordle Helper* you have to write the word and you can change the state of characters of that word by taping on a single character. And after that you have to click on *Next* button to write next word. After clicking on a next button you will see a *Show* button to show remaining words of that step in a modal.
